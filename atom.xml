    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, cruel world.</p>

<p>My name is Andrey and this is by first post.
That is my first experience in blogging and writing texts in English. Before writing first post I tried to find some answers for common questions of beginner bloggers.</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s this blog about?</h3>

<p>Well, That is my space to write about some issues that interested me. Also I would like to use blog to share my observations and results.</p>

<h3>What I would like to receive from blog?</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s very easy. I want to increase skills in English and text writing. I guess that appearance (text, speech or presentation) helps to clearly enunciate and understand idea I would like to perform. Also, it helps to receive best feedback and suggestion.</p>

<p>If you find that my blog is interested for you it will be great too.</p>

<p>So, welcome to my blog.</p>
